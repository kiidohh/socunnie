            <div class="mbr-article mbr-article--wysiwyg col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"><p>Let me tell you a story, there is a girl who goes by the name of Soeun. Back when she was still young and naive, she kept on telling her parents that she want to be a chef when she grew up. Her passion for cooking started as young a 5, when the little girl saw her mother cooking in the kitchen and she aspires to be a great cook just like her mother. As years passed, the girl got into elementary school, middle school and then high school, but her dream is still the same. She wants to work in a 5-star restaurant, and lead the chefs to cook up the best dishes and emerge as a Michelin Star acknowledged restaurant.</p><p>Working towards her dream, the bright and cheerful youth is excited to start her journey of being a culinary student in college, however that dream got crushed pretty fast the moment she started college. Little did she know about how tough it could be as a culinary student, but there was still a bit of hope in her to work towards that dream. She picked herself up and continued working hard to be the best culinary student. However, there were some setback that she could not avoid. With her father being the only breadwinner of the family, she had to take a student loan for the college fees, and that was when she decided that she should get some part time jobs to help pay for the loans.</p><p>During that time, the aspiring youth was already receiving some attention with the little adventures here and there along with the simple recipes she has modified and shared with her followers on her blog, and the thought of adding a part-time job to juggling between college and her blogging, it felt like a whole new challenge, but a daughter's gotta do what a daughter's gotta do (to help her parents 😊). As if luck was on her side, she was offered to be the face of the culinary department to , and a few modeling offers came her way afterwards. Life went on that way for a while, and things started to get better on her side.</p><p>As her social circle expanded, so did the number of followers on her blog. There were requests to try out some recipes or recommendations for places to eat, and some followers were asking her about her skin care routine. Her blog became more and more active as she communicated with her followers and she is always thankful for the responses they gave, as they motivated her to explore more. Unconsciously, her inital dream of being the head chef in a Michelin Star acknowledged restaurant started to see some changes. Towards the end of her final year, she that her job scope has shifted from what was originally planned.</p><p>However, her career in the culinary industry did not come to a complete end. Her father's cafe was also one of the reasons why she wants to be a chef. You see, some time in the future, once she has achieved her dream, she planned to make her father's cafe the best in town, but that goal has changed. Through her communications with her followers she found out that almost everyone wants to dine at a place where they can feel comfortable and have fun with their friends and families. That led her to think about how it can be incorporated into a cafe, and she found just the perfect idea.</p><p>With the money she has earned from her side jobs during college, she got permission from her father to revamp the cafe and a year after she graduated, 'Game A Latte' started its operations. She knew how college students need an outlet to release their stress, so with a cafe that sells allows them to play either board games or gaming consoles while they dine on affordable and filling food, she felt accomplished. Besides making sure that everything in the cafe runs smoothly,</p></div>
